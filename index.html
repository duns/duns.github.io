         <h2>ATWSS</h2>
<p>To supervise underground activity in the <a href="http://cern.ch/atlas">ATLAS</a> 
experiment at <a href="http://www.cern.ch">CERN</a>, mostly in radioactive areas, the ATLAS
Wireless Safety System was designed to visualize and record a user's activity. The user has a camera on the helmet 
and several measurement devices (radiation, heartrate, temperature, O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>),
which are read out continuously using a PTU box. I designed and wrote the Data Acquisition Server and the Web display 
for this project. In the <a href="http://cern.ch/edusafe">EDUSAFE</a> project ATWSS is taken onboard and 
extended with Augmented Reality to provide the user with an interactive view of the procedures he needs
to execute during his underground activity.

         <h2>ADEPO</h2>
<p>After opening the ATLAS detector it needs to be repositioned in the same place as before. 
To accurately do this a system of BCAMs is in place to measure the exact position of a number
of subdetector systems. A readout system was created in C++ using the QT Framework and some
ATLAS specific software. It is in use during the closure of ATLAS in a interactive fashion
and runs in monitoring mode while ATLAS is closed and in operation to see if there is any movement. 
The system is maintained and currently being extended by me.

         <h2>ATLAS OTP</h2>
<p>To account for all the non-physics work in the ATLAS experiment, accounting is done using the Operation Task Planner (OTP). 
This tool, written in Java, translated into a WebApp using Google Web Toolkit (gwt), fills a Database
with work done by ATLAS users. The same tool is also used to subscribe to shifts and on-call duties. 
The Database is subsequently used by SAP to generate a number of reports for both the users, management and 
the ATLAS funding agencies. I maintain the OTP WebApp, write all the reports and generate the necessary information.

         <h2>WIRED</h2>
<p>The World-Wide Web Interactive Remote Event Display was originally created as a Java Applet in 1995 for the DELPHI experiment
at CERN. It later evolved to a stand-alone application framework for Event Display for numerous other experiments at CERN. 
At SLAC I extended WIRED to become a plugin into the Java Analysis Studio (JAS) framework, where it has the Linear Collider
as its main experiment. WIRED continues to be maintained and extended by the team at SLAC.</a>

         <h2>Maven NAR Plugin</h2>
<p>Originally I wrote a Native (language) plugin for Maven 1, to compile JNI C and C++ libraries
for FreeHEP. Later I extended this NAR (Native ARchive) plugin for Maven 2 to also handle
standalone C and C++ code compilation. The code was donated to 
Sonatype and later on put into github where it is currently maintained by others. Both the   
<a href="http://duns.github.io/maven-nar-plugin/">original site</a> and the  
<a href="https://github.com/maven-nar/nar-maven-plugin">new site</a> are on github. 
As part of the project I used NAR to create a 
<a href="http://duns.github.com/maven-swig-plugin/">Maven Swig Plugin</a> to run <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>
and created a
<a href="http://github.com/duns/cpptasks-parallel">parallel and updated version</a> of <a href="http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/cpptasks/">CPPTasks</a>.

         <h2>Vector Graphics</h2>
<p>In the WIRED project we needed a general library to provide Java VectorGraphics output
in a number of formats. Carl Loomis wrote the original VectorGraphics to provide output in 
Encapsulated PostScript. I extended and generalized the library to handle fonts and provide 
output to other vector formats, such as PDF, SWF (Flash), SVG and EMF. The latest code is maintained and
available on <a href="https://github.com/freehep/freehep-vectorgraphics">github</a>.

         <h2>FreeHEP</h2>
<p>At SLAC, with Tony Johnson, and later on at CERN I worked on a number of OpenSource libraries within the 
<a href="http://java.freehep.org">FreeHEP</a> framework. A non-exhaustive list is given below:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://freehep.github.com/freehep-typed-properties">Typed Properties Library for Java</a></li>
<li><a href="http://freehep.github.com/freehep-io/">IO Extension Library for Java</a></li>

         <h2>SipML5</h2>
<p>SIP is a protocol for audio and video over the internet. SipML5 is the WebRTC implementation of SIP in a browser. 
For usage in the ATWSS project I 
translated the JavaScript version of the <a href="http://sipml5.org">SipML5</a> Demo into Java 
and further extended the gwt-sipml5 library. 
The demo uses the
<a href="https://github.com/duns/gwt-sipml5">gwt-sipml5</a> library.
The gwt-sipml5 package allows you to use SipML5 from Java. A Live demo page is available on 
<a href="http://gwt-sipml5.appspot.com/">app-engine</a> (needs WebRTC, chrome will do).

         <h2>PostScript Viewer</h2>
<p>To test out the Vector Graphics library for Java I wrote a PostScript viewer in Java.
It is not complete, but implements most PostScript commands. A debugger was added as an educational feature so that one
can actually follow how a stack-processor works.

         <h2>CERN Map</h2>
<p>
In 1991 CERN designed the World-Wide Web. In 1994 I used a hand-drawn PostScript Map of the
CERN buildings, which have a totally historical numbering scheme, to provide an interface
on the web to find your way around CERN. The interface used a Perl script and a PostScript
interpreter (GhostScript) to produce Gif images of the map, locating the building searched for.
Remember, google maps did not exist at that time, in fact google did not exist yet...
